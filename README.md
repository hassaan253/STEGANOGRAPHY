# BEE12C-STEGANOGRAPHY-M.-Ali-Farooq
Project for Digital Signal Processing Course

## Overview
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. Steganography can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content; the data to be hidden can be hidden inside almost any other type of digital content. The block diagram shows a general approach to steganography.

## Specifications
Depending on the nature of the cover object(actual object in which secret data is embedded),
steganography can be divided into five types:
1. Text Steganography
2. Image Steganography
3. Video Steganography
4. Audio Steganography
5. Network Steganography
The purpose of this project is to implement text, image and audio steganography in MATLAB
using the Random and Statistical Generation, Encrypt and Scatter and Least Significant Bit
Encoding methods, respectively.
